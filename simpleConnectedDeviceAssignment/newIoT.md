sending = data from moisture sensor in a pot
receiving = if receiving data then display them on the website
= record the last time the plant has been watered (I would first need to measure how much the moisture increases every time the plant is watered and then if there was at least a partial increase like that it would record that the plant has been watered)
= possibly inlude the option to choose a plant type / species and show reminders if the plant hasn't been watered for a long time or the moisture level is too low
= or user chooses what's the lowest moisture level / maximum days without water manually on the website the first time (somehow have to identify one plant from another)
= saves some data for a long term: last watering
= short term: last and current moisture level
